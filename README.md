🏠 Tehran Housing Price Prediction

A machine learning project for predicting housing prices in Tehran

📌 About the Project

This project builds a machine learning model that predicts house prices in Tehran based on features such as area, number of rooms, building age, and district.
The goal is to create a system for property price analysis and provide a usable model for future predictions.

📊 Features
